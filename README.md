## Hi There!ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Hossam Hatem**. I'm a _CS Graduate_, and _Software Engineer_, and _Open Source Enthusiast_. I love to solve problems, build cool projects, and share my knowledge with my fellows.

- I was a Software Engineering Intern [**@Fawry**](https://www.fawry.com/).
- I'm a [**Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)'2025 Contributor [**@Mifos Initiative**](https://github.com/openmf).
- I enjoy League Of Legends, Football, and Anime (especially [**Hunter X Hunter**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098220/)).
